<p><b>The problem.</b>
The <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_puzzle">8-puzzle</a>
is a sliding puzzle
<!--  invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. -->
that is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square tiles labeled 1 through 8, plus a blank 
square. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in row-major order, using
as few moves as possible. 
You are permitted to slide tiles either horizontally or vertically
into the blank square. 
The following diagram
shows a sequence of moves from an <em>initial board</em> (left)
to the <em>goal board</em> (right).

<p><center>
<IMG SRC="4moves.png" width = "600" alt =  "8puzzle 4 moves">
</center>

<p><br><b>Board data type.</b>
To begin, create a data type that models an <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em>
board with sliding tiles.
Implement an immutable data type <code>Board</code> with the following API:

<p>

<blockquote><pre class = "api">
public class Board {

    <span class = "comment">// create a board from an n-by-n array of tiles,</span>
    <span class = "comment">// where tiles[row][col] = tile at (row, col)</span>
    public Board(int[][] tiles)
                                           
    <span class = "comment">// string representation of this board</span>
    public String toString()

    <span class = "comment">// board dimension n</span>
    public int dimension()

    <span class = "comment">// number of tiles out of place</span>
    public int hamming()

    <span class = "comment">// sum of Manhattan distances between tiles and goal</span>
    public int manhattan()

    <span class = "comment">// is this board the goal board?</span>
    public boolean isGoal()

    <span class = "comment">// does this board equal y?</span>
    public boolean equals(Object y)

    <span class = "comment">// all neighboring boards</span>
    public Iterable&lt;Board&gt; neighbors()

    <span class = "comment">// a board that is obtained by exchanging any pair of tiles</span>
    public Board twin()

    <span class = "comment">// unit testing (not graded)</span>
    public static void main(String[] args)

}</pre></blockquote>

<p><em>Constructor.&nbsp;</em>
You may assume that the constructor receives an <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em> array
containing the <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> integers between 0 and <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> &minus; 1,
where 0 represents the blank square.
You may also assume that 2 &le; <em>n</em> < 128.

<p><em>String representation.&nbsp;</em>
The <code>toString()</code> method returns a string composed of <em>n</em> + 1 lines.
The first line contains the board size <em>n</em>; the remaining <em>n</em> lines contains
the <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em> grid of tiles in row-major order,
using 0 to designate the blank square.

<p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="string-representation.png" width = "225" alt =  "String representation">
</center>

<p><em>Hamming and Manhattan distances.&nbsp;</em>
To measure how close a board is to the goal board, we define two notions of distance.
The <em>Hamming distance</em> betweeen a board and the goal board is 
the number of tiles in the wrong position.
The <em>Manhattan distance</em> between a board and the goal board is
the sum of the Manhattan distances (sum of the vertical and horizontal distance)
from the tiles to their goal positions.

<p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="hamming-manhattan.png" width = "500" alt =  "Hamming and Manhattan distances">
</center>

<p><em>Comparing two boards for equality.&nbsp;</em>
Two boards are equal if they are have the same size and their corresponding tiles are in the same positions.
The <code>equals()</code> method is inherited from <code>java.lang.Object</code>,
so it must obey all of Java’s requirements.

<p><em>Neighboring boards.&nbsp;</em>
The <code>neighbors()</code> method returns an iterable containing the neighbors of the board.
Depending on the location of the blank square, a board can have 2, 3, or 4 neighbors.

<p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="neighbors3.png" width = "400" alt =  "Neighboring boards">
</center>

<p><em>Unit testing.&nbsp;</em>
Your <code>main()</code> method should call each public method directly and
help verify that they works as prescribed (e.g., by printing results to standard output).

<p><em>Performance requirements.&nbsp;</em>
Your implementation should support all <code>Board</code> methods in time
proportional to <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> (or better) in the worst case.

</ul>






<p>
<b>A* search.</b>
Now, we describe a solution to the 8-puzzle problem that illustrates a 
general artificial intelligence methodology known as the
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search algorithm</a>.
We define a <em>search node</em> of the game to be a board, the number
of moves made to reach the board, and the previous search node.
First, insert the initial search node
(the initial board, 0 moves, and a null previous search node) 
into a priority queue. Then,
delete from the priority queue the search node with the minimum priority,
and insert onto the priority queue all neighboring search nodes
(those that can be reached in one move from the dequeued search node).
Repeat this procedure until the search node dequeued corresponds to the goal board.

<p>
The efficacy of this approach
hinges on the choice of <em>priority function</em> for a search node. We 
consider two priority functions:

<ul>

<li>The <em>Hamming priority function</em>
is the Hamming distance of a board plus 
the number of moves made so far to get to the search node.
Intuitively, a search node with a small number of tiles in the wrong position
is close to the goal, and we prefer a search node if has been reached
using a small number of moves.

<p><li> The <em>Manhattan priority function</em> is
the Manhattan distance of a board
plus the number of moves made so far to get to the search node.

</ul>

<p>
To solve the puzzle from
a given search node on the priority queue, the total number of moves we
need to make (including those already made) is at least its priority,
using either the Hamming or Manhattan priority function. Why?
<!--
(For Hamming priority, this is true because each tile that is out of place
must move at least once to reach its goal position.
For Manhattan priority, this is true because each tile must move
its Manhattan distance from its goal position.
Note that we do not count the blank square when computing the
Hamming or Manhattan priorities.)
-->
Consequently, when the goal board is dequeued, we
have discovered not only a sequence of moves from the
initial board to the goal board, but one that makes the <em>fewest</em> moves. 
(Challenge for the mathematically inclined: prove this fact.)

<p><b>Game tree.</b>
One way to view the computation is as a <em>game tree</em>, where each search node
is a node in the game tree and the children of a node correspond to its
neighboring search nodes. The root of the game tree is the initial search node;
the internal nodes have already been processed; the leaf nodes are maintained
in a <em>priority queue</em>; at each step, the A* algorithm removes the node with the smallest
priority from the priority queue and processes it (by adding its children
to both the game tree and the priority queue).

<p>
For example, the following diagram illustrates the game tree after each of the 
first three steps of running the A* search algorithm on a 3-by-3 puzzle using the Manhattan priority function.

<center>
<IMG SRC="game-tree.png" width = "800" alt =  "8puzzle game tree">
</center>



<p><br><b>Solver data type.</b>
In this part, you will implement A* search to solve <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em> slider puzzles.
Create an immutable data type <code>Solver</code> with the following API:

<blockquote>
<pre class = "api">
public class Solver {

    <span class = "comment">// find a solution to the initial board (using the A* algorithm)</span>
    public Solver(Board initial)

    <span class = "comment">// is the initial board solvable? (see below)</span>
    public boolean isSolvable()

    <span class = "comment">// min number of moves to solve initial board</span>
    public int moves()

    <span class = "comment">// sequence of boards in a shortest solution</span>
    public Iterable&lt;Board&gt; solution()

    <span class = "comment">// test client (see below)</span> 
    public static void main(String[] args)

}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Implementation requirement.&nbsp;</em>
To implement the A* algorithm, 
you must use the
<a href = "https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/javadoc/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/MinPQ.html"><code>MinPQ</code></a>
data type for the priority queue.

<p><em>Corner case.&nbsp;</em>
Throw an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> in the constructor if the argument is 
<code>null</code>.

<p><em>Test client.</em>
The following test client takes the name of an input file as a command-line argument
and prints the minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle and a corresponding solution.


<blockquote><pre>
public static void main(String[] args) {

    <font color = gray>// create initial board from file</font>
    In in = new In(args[0]);
    int n = in.readInt();
    int[][] tiles = new int[n][n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            tiles[i][j] = in.readInt();
    Board initial = new Board(tiles);

    <font color = gray>// solve the puzzle</font>
    Solver solver = new Solver(initial);

    <font color = gray>// print solution to standard output</font>
    if (!solver.isSolvable())
        StdOut.println("No solution possible");
    else {
        StdOut.println("Minimum number of moves = " + solver.moves());
        for (Board board : solver.solution())
            StdOut.println(board);
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

The input file contains the board size <em>n</em>, followed by the <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em>
grid of tiles, using 0 to designate the blank square.

<span id = "optimizations"></span>
<p><b>Two optimizations.</b>
To speed up your solver, implement the following two optimizations:

<ul>
<p><li><em>The critical optimization.</em>
A* search has one annoying feature:
search nodes corresponding to the same board
are enqueued on the priority queue many times
(e.g., the bottom-left search node in the game-tree diagram above).
To reduce unnecessary exploration of useless search nodes,
when considering the neighbors of a search node, don’t enqueue
a neighbor if its board is the same as the board of the
previous search node in the game tree.

<p><center>
<IMG SRC="critical-optimization.png" width = "600" alt =  "8puzzle critical optimization">
</center>

<p><li><em>Caching the Hamming and Manhattan priorities.</em>
To avoid recomputing the Manhattan priority of a search node from scratch each time during
various priority queue operations, pre-compute its value when you construct the search node;
save it in an instance variable; and return the saved value as needed.
This caching technique is broadly applicable: consider using it in any situation where you
are recomputing the same quantity many times and for which computing that quantity is a bottleneck 
operation.

</ul>


<p><b>Detecting unsolvable boards.</b>
Not all initial boards can lead to the goal board by a sequence of moves,
including these two:

<p><center>
<IMG SRC="unsolvable.png" width = "250" alt =  "unsolvable slider puzzles">
</center>

<p>
To detect such situations,
use the fact that boards
are divided into two equivalence classes with respect to reachability:
<ul>
<p><li> Those that can lead to the goal board
<p><li> Those that can lead to the goal board if we modify the initial board by
swapping any pair of tiles (the blank square is not a tile).
</ul>

(Difficult challenge for the mathematically inclined: prove this fact.)
To apply the fact, 
run the A* algorithm on <em>two</em> puzzle instances&mdash;one with the
initial board and one with the initial board modified by
swapping a pair of tiles&mdash;in lockstep
(alternating back and forth between exploring search nodes in each of
the two game trees).
Exactly one of the two will lead to the goal board.

<!--
<p><li> Derive a mathematical formula that tells you whether a board is 
solvable or not.

</ul>
-->
